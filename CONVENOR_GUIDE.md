   - Tailors responses based on previous discussions

## How to Use

### Starting a Conversation

1. **Open the Streamlit UI** (default: http://localhost:8501)
2. **Select Convenor Mode** in the sidebar (recommended)
3. **Ask your question** naturally, as you would to a module convenor

### Example Conversations

#### Assignment Help
```
You: "I'm working on my essay about machine learning. Can you help me understand 
the key concepts I should cover?"

EduMate: "Of course! For your essay on machine learning, let me guide you through 
the key concepts you should cover based on our course materials [â‘ ]...

Consider structuring your essay around:
1. Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning [â‘ ]
2. Key algorithms covered in Week 3-5 [â‘¡]
3. Real-world applications [â‘¢]

As you work on this, think about: How do these concepts connect to the learning 
outcomes we discussed? What examples from the lectures best illustrate these ideas?

Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific area?"
```

#### Feedback Request
```
You: "I'm not sure if my approach to the lab assignment is correct. Can you 
give me feedback?"

EduMate: "I'd be happy to provide guidance! From our course materials [â‘ ], the 
lab assignment should focus on...

To assess your approach, consider these questions:
- Does it address all the required components mentioned in the brief [â‘¡]?
- Have you incorporated the concepts from Week 4 lectures [â‘¢]?
- Is your methodology sound and well-justified?

What specific part of your approach are you uncertain about? That will help me 
provide more targeted feedback."
```

#### Concept Explanation
```
You: "Can you explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?"

EduMate: "Great question! Let me explain this clearly with reference to our 
course materials [â‘ ]...

**Supervised Learning:** [explanation with examples from course]
**Unsupervised Learning:** [explanation with examples from course]

To help you understand this better, consider: What problems would each approach 
be suitable for? Can you think of examples from the assignments where we've used 
each type?

The key distinction is in the role of labeled data, which we covered in depth 
in Week 3 [â‘¡]."
```

### Session Memory

EduMate remembers your conversation within a session (1 hour timeout):

```
You: "What are the learning outcomes for this module?"
EduMate: [Provides learning outcomes from course materials]

You: "How does my assignment relate to these?"
EduMate: "Based on what we just discussed about the learning outcomes, your 
assignment directly addresses..." [References previous answer]
```

A: Session data is temporary (1-hour lifetime) and stored in memory only. Nothing is persisted beyond the session timeout.
