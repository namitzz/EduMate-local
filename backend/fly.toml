# fly.toml - Fly.io configuration for EduMate Backend API
# 
# ⚠️ FREE TIER CONFIGURATION ⚠️
# This configuration is optimized for Fly.io's free tier to ensure NO CHARGES.
# 
# Free tier includes:
# - 3 shared-cpu-1x VMs with 256MB RAM each
# - 160GB outbound data transfer per month
# - Automatic start/stop to conserve resources
# 
# IMPORTANT: Monitor your usage at https://fly.io/dashboard
# To set spending limits: fly orgs billing-limits set
# To check current usage: fly billing show

# ⚠️ NO PERSISTENT VOLUMES - Data will be ephemeral
# For production with persistent data, you would need:
# [[mounts]]
#   source = "edumate_data"
#   destination = "/app/chroma_db"
# But this requires paid storage on Fly.io

# ⚠️ NO PAID ADD-ONS ENABLED
# No databases, no Redis, no object storage

# DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
#
# 1. Install flyctl CLI: https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/
# 2. Login: fly auth login
# 3. Deploy: fly deploy (in backend directory)
# 4. Check logs: fly logs
# 5. Monitor usage: fly billing show
# 6. Set spending cap: fly orgs billing-limits set
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - This backend uses OpenRouter API (cloud LLM) - no local Ollama needed
# - OpenRouter API key is pre-configured in config.py
# - The ChromaDB vector database will be ephemeral (data lost on restart)
# - For persistent storage, consider using external services or paid volumes
# - Free tier includes 3 VMs with 256MB RAM each and 160GB transfer/month
#
# UPDATING FRONTEND:
# The Streamlit frontend at ui/app_simple.py is already configured to use:
# API_BASE_URL = "https://edumate-local.fly.dev/"
#
# For Streamlit Cloud deployment:
# - Point Streamlit Cloud to the main branch
# - Set the main file path to: ui/app_simple.py
# - No secrets needed - API URL is hardcoded in app_simple.py
