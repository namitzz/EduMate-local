# Streamlit Cloud Secrets Example
# 
# This file shows the format for secrets if you need to use them in the future.
# Currently, the app doesn't use secrets because the API URL is hardcoded in app_simple.py
#
# If you want to make the API URL configurable via secrets:
# 1. Add this to your Streamlit Cloud app settings under "Secrets"
# 2. Update app_simple.py to read from st.secrets instead of hardcoding

# Example (not currently used):
# [api]
# base_url = "https://edumate-local.fly.dev/"
