# Ollama Connection Issue - Fix Summary

## Problem Statement
Users were experiencing "Unable to connect to the AI model (Ollama)" error. The issue needed to be fixed and the codebase checked for other potential issues.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Inconsistent OLLAMA_HOST Fallback Logic (backend/models.py)
**Problem:** 
- The `ollama_complete()` and `ollama_complete_stream()` functions had redundant checks for `OLLAMA_HOST`
- They used a different fallback URL (`http://host.docker.internal:11434`) than the one in `config.py` (`http://ollama:11434`)
- This could cause confusion and inconsistent behavior

**Fix:**
- Simplified to use `config.OLLAMA_HOST` directly
- Removed redundant environment variable checks
- Ensured consistent URL usage across all functions

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/models.py` lines 7, 63

### 2. Poor Local Development Experience (backend/config.py)
**Problem:**
- Default OLLAMA_HOST was `http://ollama:11434` which only works in Docker
- Local developers would get connection errors until they manually configured OLLAMA_HOST

**Fix:**
- Changed default to `http://localhost:11434` for better local development experience
- Docker deployments override this via `docker-compose.yml` (sets `OLLAMA_HOST=http://ollama:11434`)
- Added validation to ensure OLLAMA_HOST is never empty or None

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/config.py` lines 62-69

### 3. Insufficient Error Logging (backend/models.py)
**Problem:**
- When connection errors occurred, the URL being used was not logged
- Made debugging difficult as users couldn't easily determine which endpoint was being attempted

**Fix:**
- Added debug logging showing the URL being attempted at the start of each request
- Included the URL in all error messages when retries fail
- Added URL logging for streaming errors

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/models.py` lines 17, 50-58, 69, 103

### 4. Error Message Enhancement (backend/main.py)
**Problem:**
- Connection error messages didn't show which URL was being attempted
- Users had to guess whether the configuration was correct

**Fix:**
- Enhanced `get_error_message()` to extract and display the URL from error details
- Now shows "**Connection attempted to:** {url}" when URL information is available
- Maintains backward compatibility - if URL info isn't available, shows original message

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/main.py` lines 65-84

### 5. Outdated .env.example (.env.example)
**Problem:**
- Example configuration showed Docker URL as default
- Could mislead local developers

**Fix:**
- Updated to show `http://localhost:11434` as the default
- Added clear comments explaining when to use which URL
- Documents that Docker sets this automatically via docker-compose.yml

**Files Changed:**
- `.env.example` lines 13-17

## Testing

### Existing Tests Verified
- ✅ `test_model_connection_error.py` - All tests pass
- ✅ Error message format is preserved
- ✅ All required troubleshooting steps are present

### Manual Verification
- ✅ Config module loads successfully
- ✅ OLLAMA_HOST defaults to `http://localhost:11434`
- ✅ models.py uses config.OLLAMA_HOST correctly

## Benefits

1. **Better Local Development:** Works out of the box for local developers
2. **Consistent Configuration:** Single source of truth for OLLAMA_HOST
3. **Easier Debugging:** Clear logging shows which URL is being used
4. **Better Error Messages:** Users see exactly what URL failed
5. **Backward Compatible:** Docker deployments continue to work without changes

## Migration Notes

### For Local Developers
- No action needed! The new default (`http://localhost:11434`) will work automatically
- Ollama must be running locally on port 11434

### For Docker Users
- No action needed! `docker-compose.yml` sets the correct URL automatically
- Existing deployments continue to work

### For Custom Deployments
- If you set `OLLAMA_HOST` or `OLLAMA_URL` environment variables, they will be respected
- Default is now `http://localhost:11434` instead of `http://ollama:11434`
- To use a different URL, set `OLLAMA_HOST` or `OLLAMA_URL` environment variable

## Configuration Priority

The code checks for OLLAMA_HOST in this order:
1. `OLLAMA_URL` environment variable (if set)
2. `OLLAMA_HOST` environment variable (if set)
3. Default: `http://localhost:11434`

## Log Messages

### Debug Messages (Normal Operation)
```
[DEBUG] Attempting to connect to Ollama at: http://localhost:11434
[DEBUG] Attempting to stream from Ollama at: http://localhost:11434
```

### Error Messages (Connection Failure)
```
[WARNING] Ollama ConnectionError on attempt 1/3: ...
[WARNING] Ollama ConnectionError on attempt 2/3: ...
[WARNING] Ollama ConnectionError on attempt 3/3: ...
[ERROR] Failed to connect to Ollama at http://localhost:11434 after 3 retries
```

### User-Facing Error Message
```
Unable to connect to the AI model (Ollama).

**Possible causes:**
• Ollama service is not running
• Connection to Ollama was refused

**What to do:**
• Check if Ollama is running: `ollama list`
• Start Ollama if needed
• Verify OLLAMA_HOST configuration
• If using Docker, ensure the ollama container is running

**Connection attempted to:** http://localhost:11434
```

## Files Modified

1. `backend/models.py` - Simplified URL handling, improved logging
2. `backend/config.py` - Better default, validation added
3. `backend/main.py` - Enhanced error messages
4. `.env.example` - Updated documentation

## No Breaking Changes

All changes are backward compatible:
- Existing environment variables are respected
- Docker deployments work without modification
- Error message format is preserved
- All existing tests pass
